**Files to create:**
```
src/lib/database/
├── models/
│   ├── User.ts
│   ├── Election.ts
│   ├── Candidate.ts
│   ├── Vote.ts
│   └── AuditLog.ts
├── queries/
│   ├── userQueries.ts
│   ├── electionQueries.ts
│   └── voteQueries.ts
└── seeders/
    └── testData.ts
```

### 2. Authentication System (Phase 3)
**Priority: HIGH** - Estimated: 2-3 days

- [ ] JWT token implementation
- [ ] Password hashing with bcrypt
- [ ] Login/logout API endpoints
- [ ] Route protection middleware
- [ ] Role-based access control
- [ ] Session management

**Files to create:**
```
src/lib/auth/
├── jwt.ts
├── password.ts
├── middleware.ts
└── rbac.ts

src/app/api/auth/
├── login/route.ts
├── logout/route.ts
└── me/route.ts
```

### 3. Basic API Endpoints (Phase 6 - Partial)
**Priority: HIGH** - Estimated: 2-3 days

- [ ] User management APIs
- [ ] Election CRUD APIs
- [ ] Voting API with blockchain integration
- [ ] Results API
- [ ] Admin APIs

**Files to create:**
```
src/app/api/
├── admin/
├── elections/
├── votes/
├── candidates/
└── results/
```

## 🎨 UI Development Plan (Phase 5)

### Suggested Order:
1. **Authentication Pages** (login forms)
2. **Admin Dashboard** (system overview)
3. **Organization Dashboard** (election management)
4. **Voter Interface** (voting interface)

### Component Architecture:
```
src/components/
├── ui/          # Basic UI components (buttons, forms, etc.)
├── auth/        # Authentication components
├── admin/       # Admin-specific components
├── organization/ # Organization dashboard components
├── voter/       # Voter interface components
└── shared/      # Shared components across roles
```

---

## 🔧 Development Workflow Recommendations

### Phase Order (Optimized for Testing):
1. **Complete Database Models** (1-2 days)
2. **Build Authentication** (2-3 days)
3. **Create Core APIs** (2-3 days)
4. **Build Admin Interface** (2-3 days)
5. **Organization Interface** (3-4 days)
6. **Voter Interface** (2-3 days)
7. **Email System Integration** (1-2 days)
8. **Testing & Security** (2-3 days)

### Testing Strategy:
- Test blockchain functions as we build APIs
- Use database seeders for consistent test data
- Test each user role workflow separately
- Validate blockchain integrity at each step

---

## 📋 Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

### Day 1-2: Database Models
1. Create User model with CRUD operations
2. Create Election and Candidate models
3. Create Vote model with blockchain integration
4. Test database operations

### Day 3-4: Authentication
1. Implement JWT token system
2. Create login API endpoints
3. Build authentication middleware
4. Test role-based access

### Day 5: Integration Testing

## 🛠️ Technical Decisions Made

### Database Choice: SQLite
- **Pros**: Simple setup, good performance for this use case, file-based
- **Cons**: Single connection (but suitable for our needs)
- **Alternative**: Can easily switch to PostgreSQL later if needed

### Blockchain Approach: In-Memory + File Storage
- **Pros**: Fast, simple, suitable for prototype
- **Cons**: Not distributed (but that's by design)
- **Security**: Implements all major blockchain security features

### Authentication: JWT + bcrypt
- **Pros**: Stateless, secure, industry standard
- **Cons**: Need to handle token expiration
- **Implementation**: Ready to implement with existing setup

- [ ] Database operations working (CRUD)
- [ ] Authentication system functional
- [ ] Blockchain vote recording working
- [ ] All three user roles can login
- [ ] Elections can be created and managed
- [ ] Votes are properly recorded and validated
- [ ] Results are accurate and verifiable

### User Experience Goals:
- [ ] Admin can manage the system
